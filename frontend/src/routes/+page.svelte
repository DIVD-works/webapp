                The goal of the DIVD.works project is to create a platform that
                brings together young digital talent and employers. We help you
                not only further develop your skills, but also find an
                internship or (part-time) job that suits you. Finding an
                internship or later a graduation internship turns out to be
                quite a challenge, causing more and more young people to give
                up. A shame, isnâ€™t it? We aim to change that! Click on of the
                buttons below to get started and enjoy your search for an
                internship or project.
